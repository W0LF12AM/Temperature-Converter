# 🌡️ Unit Converter — First Kotlin Android Project

This project is a simple **temperature unit converter Android application** built as my first hands-on experience using Kotlin for native Android development.

The app focuses on learning Android fundamentals such as **MVVM architecture**, **ViewModel state handling**, and **LiveData observation**, combined with basic UI animation and custom input handling.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created to:

- Learn Kotlin syntax and Android development fundamentals  
- Understand MVVM architecture implementation in real apps  
- Practice ViewModel + LiveData state management  
- Explore Android UI interaction and simple animation  

---

## ✨ Main Features

- Temperature conversion between **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**
- Custom numeric keypad input
- Unit swap with animation
- Reactive UI updates using LiveData

---

## 🏗️ Tech & Concepts Used

**Language**
- Kotlin

**Architecture**
- MVVM (Model – View – ViewModel)

**Android Components**
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- AppCompat Activity

**UI**
- XML Layout
- Basic View Animation
- Edge-to-Edge Layout Support

---

## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

- How Android handles UI and lifecycle
- Separating UI logic and business logic using MVVM
- Observing state changes using LiveData
- Structuring Android project in a scalable way
- Handling user input through custom UI components

---

## 📱 App Overview

The app allows users to:
1. Input numbers using a custom keypad
2. Choose temperature unit
3. Convert values instantly
4. Swap conversion units with visual feedback animation

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Learning Roadmap)

- Add more temperature units (Kelvin, etc)
- Implement conversion history
- Migrate UI to Jetpack Compose
- Add unit testing for ViewModel
- Expand into multi-unit converter (Length, Weight, etc)

## 👨‍💻 Developer Note

This is a learning project and part of my journey exploring native Android development using Kotlin.
